repubblica_di_venezia_title;The Republic of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
repubblica_di_venezia_desc;Since the times of our roman ancestors, Venice has been a republic. This monarchic regime is a shame for our glorious history. The people of Saint Mark are not the salves of a king! Let's reinstitute the Serenisima - Viva Venezia, Viva San Marco!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

claim_candia_aegeans_title;Project our power in the Aegeans Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
claim_candia_aegeans_desc;Our trade always went toward east, the east from where spices and silk come from.

claim_ciprus_title;Reconquest of Ciprus;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
