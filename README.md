# Less Historical Flavour Mod
This is a fork of HFM where I want to add flavour to some countries (namely Venice, Babylon and Byzanthium).
Current Version: 0
How to download and install:
1. Click the green "Code" button on top
3. Click on "Downlaod ZIP" (the branch "main" should work without many issues...I hope)
4. Extract the zip file, copy/move "LHFM" Folder & "LHFM.mod" into "Steam\steamapps\steamapps\common\Victoria 2\mod" or into your "mod" folder in the installation folder of Victoria 2, if you didn't get it from Steam
5. Activate LHFM in your Victoria 2 Launcher

Currently working on: Venice flavour
