# Less Historical Flavour Mod
This is a fork of HFM where I want to add flavour to some countries (namely Venice, Babylon and Byzanthium).
Current Version: 0  How to download and install:
1. Click the green "Code" button on top
3. Click on "Downlaod ZIP" (I'll try to put on main only working commits)
4. Extract the zip file, copy/move "LessH-FM" Folder & "LessH-FM.mod" into "Steam\steamapps\steamapps\common\Victoria 2\mod" or into your "mod" folder in the installation folder of Victoria 2, if you didn't get it from Steam
5. Activate LessH-FM in your Victoria 2 Launcher

Currently working on: Venice flavour
